        // Packaging Tool
        // Traditionally, to deliver Java code, an application developer would simply send out a JAR file that the user was
        // supposed to run inside their own JVM.
        // However, users rather expected an installer that they'd double click to install the package on their native platforms,
        // such as Windows or macOS.
        // This JEP aims to do precisely that. Developers can use jlink to condense the JDK down to the minimum required
        // modules, and then use this packaging tool to create a lightweight image that can be installed as an exe on Windows
        // or a dmg on a macOS.

        //$ jlink --add-modules java.base,java.sql --output myjre
        //$ jpackage --name myapp --input lib --main-jar main.jar --runtime-image myjre
